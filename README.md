# Credit Card Clients Default Modelling

This repo contains a *full Machine Learning journey for any financial analyst*, like me, that will be dealing with *credit risk assessments* in his/her career ðŸš€

Referring to the master piece work about the topic, [Credit Risk Modelling by David Jamieson Bolder](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-94688-7?source=shoppingads&locale=en-it), we present different Machine Learning models to determine [on the Taiwan Credit Default dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients) (please, refer to this detailed [data sheet here](DATASHEET.md) and to the data folder where the data is actually in) if a client **will be defaulting or not**.

The challenge here is to solve a **binary classification problem**: we will determine if an **unknown client** will be dafaulting or not **given previous clients' defaults**. We will give to them labels therefore classes.

Each model presented in the Jupyter Notebook has the following procedural steps:

1. *hyperparameters tuning (using [Bayes Optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization)),*
2. *model training and model fitting,*
3. *single model performance metrics.*

At the end of the notebook, we act **overall models comparison** to choose the best model.
We report that in the Notebook we've performed EDA (i.e. *exploratory data analysis*), too, just at the beginning of the notebook itself.
Please, refer to the model card [here](MODELCARD.md) to gain model and process specifications with deeper details.

Happy coding and learning to you all !
