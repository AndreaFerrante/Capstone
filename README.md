# Credit Card Clients Default Modelling

This repo contains one *full Machine Learning journey for any financial analyst* that will be dealing with *credit risk assessments* in his/her career.

Referring to the master piece work about the topic, [Credit Risk Modelling by David Jamieson Bolder](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-94688-7?source=shoppingads&locale=en-it), we present different Machine Learning models to determine [on the Taiwan Credit Default dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients) (please, refer to this detailed [data sheet here](DATASHEET.md) and to the data folder where the data is actually in) if a client **will be defaulting or not**.

The challange is a *classification problem* since we will be determine if an **unknown client** will be dafaulting or not **given previous clients' defaults**.

Each model we have managed in the Jupyter Notebook has the following procedural steps:

1. *Initial training and model fitting,*
2. *Single model performance metrics,*
3. *Hyperparameters tuning,*
4. *Overall models comparison.*

We report that in the Notebook we've performed EDA (i.e. *exploratory data analysis*), too.
In general, refer to proceses detailed [model card here](MODELCARD.md) to see any model step in deeper details.

Happy coding and learning to you all !
