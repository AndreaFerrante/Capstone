# Model Card

We have been referring to the following model cards: [example Google model cards](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/model-reports).
In our case, since we are modelling here a **binary classification problem**, we have compared different algorithms (SVM, GBM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, kNN) to find out that Random Forest is the one that performs the best. In order to have a correct dataset, we have balanced the data used.

## Model Description

**Input:**
  1. 
  2.
  3.
  
**Output:** Describe the output(s) of your model

**Model Architecture:** Describe the model architecture youâ€™ve used

## Performance

Give a summary graph or metrics of how the model performs. Remember to include how you are measuring the performance and what data you analysed it on. 

## Limitations

Outline the limitations of your model.

## Trade-offs

Outline any trade-offs of your model, such as any circumstances where the model exhibits performance issues.
